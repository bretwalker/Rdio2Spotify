Edit main.py, setting [Rdio API](http://www.rdio.com/developers/your-apps/) and [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications) credentials in the first four variables.
The Rdio and Spotify API apps must have http://127.0.0.1:8123/ in their list of redirect URIs.  After pasting the OAuth links printed to the terminal into your browser, retrun to the terminal when the authentication finishes.
